Version 0.4 has the following updates

# Added Parameters
- Originator Queue max size as input parameter
- Relay Queue Max size as input parameter
- Added nRF52840, nRF52832, nRF52810 as options for IC
- Updated to correct options for TX Power and Bitrate depending on IC
- Ramp up time [us] (Time to switch between RX and TX mode)

# Removed Parameters
- Removed Advertisement Roles as input parameter as it was not modelled according to the BLE Mesh spec


# Changes in the model
ReceiverSensitivity is now in accordance with the Product Spec on the different IC.
Added a PowerMonitor in the PHY layer to record the background noise
New Phy layer = WirelessPhyBTLE
New Mac layer = Mac/BTLEmesh
The new layers gives a better encapsulation and more correctly models the BLE Mesh stack.
